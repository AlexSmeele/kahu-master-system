# Kahu Design Principles

1. **Guardian, not owner**  
   Language and flows reinforce responsibility, empathy, and partnership with the dog.

2. **Calm, not noisy**  
   UI is clean, uncluttered, and low-anxiety. Animations support focus, not distraction.

3. **Evidence-based, not gimmicky**  
   Training and advice are grounded in animal behaviour science.

4. **Guided, not overwhelming**  
   Break complex tasks into clear, digestible steps with strong defaults.

5. **Accessible by default**  
   Good contrast, large touch targets, clear copy, and inclusive visuals.

6. **Mobile-first**  
   Designed around phone use, with clear handling of different device sizes, notches, and the dynamic island.
