# Kahu Brand Voice

Kahu’s voice is:

- **Calm and reassuring**
- **Evidence-based and practical**
- **Empowering and supportive**
- **Non-judgmental**

Guidelines:

- Use “guardian” instead of “owner”.
- Use plain, direct language.
- Avoid guilt/shame framing.
- In stressful contexts (health scares, behaviour issues), be extra gentle and step-by-step.

Examples:

- ✅ “Here’s a simple way to help Jett feel calmer when you leave the house.”
- ❌ “You’ve been doing this wrong; you must never do that again.”
