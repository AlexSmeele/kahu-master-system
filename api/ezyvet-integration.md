# ezyVet Integration – Overview (Draft)

Goals:

- Create bookings from Kahu into ezyVet.
- Sync updates between Kahu and ezyVet (appointments, key health info).
- Handle permissions so clinics only access authorised dog data.

When detailed contracts are ready, define:

- Endpoints used
- Request/response shapes
- Auth/permissions
- Webhook flows
